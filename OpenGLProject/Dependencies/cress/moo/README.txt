DESCRIPTION
-----------

Moo is a header-only C++ library of classes for easy memory encapsulation.



INSALLATION
-----------

Copy-paste the 'cress' folder to your project dependencies directory.
The 'cress/moo' folder contains all headers of the library.
Include the headers in cpp code:

	#include <cress/moo/moo.hpp>

Notes:
All header files except 'moo.hpp' are independent; they can be copy-pasted on their own and still work.
Some depend on standard headers like <string>.
The 'moo.hpp' header file's purpose is to #include all of the headers in this library.
