MULTIPLAYER:

- There is a config file (config.txt) in the same folder as the executable.
  This is where you must set your username and servername before starting the application.
- Basically there is no multiplayer, because of the copious amounts of errors I have encountered. Sorry.



CONTROLS:

- Menu buttons can be clicked with the left mouse button,
  or you can press the key shown in () brackets.

- I/J/K/L to orbit the camera.
- Some scenes let you set a target position by clicking the left mouse button in the scene.
- (Robotron...)
- W/A/S/D or arrow keys to move your player character.
- SPACE/E to shoot.
